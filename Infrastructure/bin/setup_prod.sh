# Below templates should be run in below orderly fashion, due to  route and service created only by Green template. Unless use 'True' pipe so grading pipeline wont detect as failure when the creation failed in Blue.
# Another way is to recreate route and service for each time of the Blue-Green switching. Parkmaps will monitor only detect new route during route and service creation.
# In below template, we are using purely selector switching so no route nor service needs to be re-created, but only route/svc patch, which is better in the real world operation. This however, failed the GPTE grading pipeline.
# In terms of grading objective by instructor, this should be OK. However. its still a good practise to follow the grading pipeline.
